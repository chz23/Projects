Operationally, a dengue cluster indicates a locality with active transmission where intervention is targeted. It is 
formed when two or more cases have onset within 14 days and are located within 150m of each other (based on 
residential and workplace addresses as well as movement history). The clusters are categorised according to 
their current status. A list of preventive actions also accompanies each alert level. There are 3 alert levels: 
Definition Alert Level 
High-risk area with 10 or more cases Red 
High-risk area with less than 10 cases Yellow 
No new cases, under surveillance for the next 21 days Green
